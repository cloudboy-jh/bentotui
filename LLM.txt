BentoTUI Agent Contract

Build against BentoTUI conventions, not generic Bubble Tea patterns.

Primary reference app
- Use `cmd/starter-app` as the canonical composition pattern.
- Shell layer order is `header -> body -> footer -> scrim -> dialog`.

Component contract
- Implement `tea.Model` plus `SetSize(width,height)` and `GetSize() (width,height)`.
- Render only inside assigned bounds; no unbounded lines or wrapping leaks.
- Route keys with precedence: dialog -> focused component -> shell/global bindings.

Style contract
- Use semantic styles from `ui/styles`.
- Avoid hardcoded per-component color literals.

Bar contract
- Header and footer are always single-row statuslines.
- Segment ownership is `left | cards | right`.
- Truncation priority is `right > left > cards`.
- Card collapse is `full card -> command only -> drop from end`.

Focus contract
- Focus manager APIs are `SetRing`, `SetIndex`, `FocusBy` with `enabled` and `wrap` controls.
- Focus changes emit `FocusChangedMsg {From, To}` deterministically.

Theme picker contract
- Selection move previews theme without persistence.
- `enter` commits.
- `esc` reverts preview to pre-open theme and closes.
